# Day 1 – Math Agent Instructions

## 📂 Folder Structure


## 📦 Requirements


## 🎯 Goal
Build a simple agent that can solve math queries.  

## 🛠️ Tools
- LangChain  
- OpenAI  
- Calculator tool  

## 🏆 Assignment
- Run at least 3 math queries with your agent (e.g., 2+2, 12*5, sqrt(144)).  
- Modify the agent to change its **temperature** setting and observe output.  

## 📝 Notes
- This agent uses `ChatOpenAI` with `llm-math` tool.  
- Later days will build on this foundation.
